This project was done in a game programming class and we had 2 programmers, 2 artists and a designer in our group. 
The game was done with Unity (C#) and it consisted of several different minigames. 
I did some of them alone and some together with the other programmer. This was my second ever game.
Here is how it looked: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYecvgupgAw&t=1s
